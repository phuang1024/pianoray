Instructions for recording and making your own video.

Recording
---------

You will need to record two files: Video and MIDI. In order to record these
files, you will need a MIDI keyboard, a camera, and a computer.

Video
^^^^^

Find a setup with a camera looking down vertically onto the keyboard.
Some things to consider:

- Safety: Make sure the camera won't fall down.
- Stability: Try to reduce shaking, e.g. from vibrations from the keyboard.
- Focus: Make sure you focus the camera onto the keyboard before recording.
  It is very disappointing to find that the video is ruined because the
  keyboard recording is blurry (speaking from experience).
- Background: If you desire, place a dark tarp under the keyboard so you can
  create the "hands floating over nothing" effect. There are some settings
  in PianoRay to dim the background and achieve this effect.
- Privacy: If you plan to release the video to the public, make sure it
  doesn't contain any private information.

MIDI
^^^^

Connect the MIDI keyboard to the computer. Use MIDI recording software to record
the MIDI. I use `MidiEditor <https://midieditor.org/>`__, which has worked great.
