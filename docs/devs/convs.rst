Conventions
===========

Conventions used internally.

- Frame zero is when the first note begins.
- Note zero is lowest note on piano.
- One ``coord`` (unit of distance) is the width of one white key
  in the video. This is equal to the horizontal resolution divided
  by 52. For example, for a 1920x1080 video, one coord is ``36.924``
  pixels.
